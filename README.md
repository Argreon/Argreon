- Greetings, I am Agreon.
- I'm just a dude who enjoys small coding and computer projects for personal use
- weather it's to have fun making them, or to make by life easier with automation, I'm constantly working on new projects
- Big fan of video games, and hope to create some public mods for a number of different games in the future
- if I ever publicly uplaod to this account, I do not wish to have monetary gain, or any type of payment for my work. I simply enjoy computers.
- That's just about all I have to say, enjoy the rest of your day! :)
